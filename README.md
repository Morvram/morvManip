This package contains python scripts for manipulating data. It's exceedingly humble but I'll add whatever scripts I happen to find useful, as I make them, in case I need them again in the future.

12/18/2023: Added script to find numbers within a string and "upgrade" or "downgrade" those numbers all by a uniform amount.
